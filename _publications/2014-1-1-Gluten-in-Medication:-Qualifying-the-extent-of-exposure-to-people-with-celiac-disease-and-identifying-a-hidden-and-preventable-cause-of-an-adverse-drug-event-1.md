Two to three million Americans have celiac disease, which is am autoimmune digestive disease. Gluten is
the main biomolecule that triggers the autoimmune reponse. Hence, the only treatment is a gluten-free diet
into perpetuity. While most people consume gluten through food, medications can be another source of gluten.
In this work, we quantify gluten levels in commonly marketed pharmaceutical drugs and report our findings.
