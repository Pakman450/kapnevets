**Abstract**
Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1), a widely explored anticancer drug target, plays an important role in single-strand DNA break repair processes. High-throughput virtual screening (HTVS) of a Maybridge small molecule library using the PARP1-benzimidazole-4-carboxamide co-crystal structure and pharmacophore model led to the identification of eleven compounds. These compounds were evaluated using recombinant PARP1 enzyme assay that resulted in the acquisition of three PARP1 inhibitors: 3 (IC50 = 12 μM), 4 (IC50 = 5.8 μM), and 10 (IC50 = 0.88 μM). Compound 4 (2,3-dihydro-1,4-benzodioxine-5-carboxamide) was selected as a lead and was subjected to further chemical modifications, involving analogue synthesis and scaffold hopping. These efforts led to the identification of (Z)-2-(4-hydroxybenzylidene)-3-oxo-3,4-dihydro-2H-benzo[b][1,4]oxazine-8-carboxamide (49, IC50 = 0.082 μM) as the most potent inhibitor of PARP1 from the series.
